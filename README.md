Introduction: <br>
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset containing reviews, where sentiments are labeled as either true or false. The goal is to develop a machine learning model, specifically a Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict the sentiment of reviews accurately. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we focus on analyzing the sentiment of reviews by classifying them as either positive (true) or negative (false).<br>
Rapidminer software from Altair has been used for implementing this analysis model.

Data Description: <br>
The dataset which was used contains 2 columns of data namely, <i>Review</i> and <i>Sentiment</i>. The <i>Review</i> column contains around 5000 unique imdB reviews on several movies while the <i>Sentiment</i> column consists of sentiment values in binary. 1 represents a positive sentiment (true).
0 represents a negative sentiment (false). The positive and negative sentiments are almost equally divided.
This whole dataset has been split into 3500:1500 reviews each. The first part is used for training the model while the rest is used for prediction purposes.

The process has been commented for convenience and better understanding of each block and operators.
